# Abstract

This project consists of creating a website for JustStreamIt, an organization known for publishing film rating,
a website written in pure HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript without any other framework, 
that allows to visualise featured movie's data.

In meeting the client's requirements, the website design should correspond to the mock-up provided, 
and display five parts: The "Best Movie", the seven "Top-Rated Movies", and any three other categories.

The three optional categories shown along the two required in the designed website are: 
Biography, Comedy and History.

# Data
The data is fetched from a local version of a home-made API named OCMovies-API, and available 
on the following code repository: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR

# Installation
* Download and install OC Movies API from the following repository: 
* https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR
* Then Run the API by starting the server.

The README file in the repository provides the steps to install the dependencies and to launch the server.

# Running the application

With the server running from the step above:

 **1 - Get this repository**
   * $ git clone https://github.com/Afudu/P4_OpenClassroom.git

 **2 - Move to the folder**
   * Unix/macOS/Windows: cd P6_OpenClassroom

 **3 - Launch the file**
   * Open the file index.html in your favorite web browser.

Note: The API server must be running to view the fetched data.

# Browser compatibility
The website has been tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and renders as expected.
