## Summary
This project involves building a movie-focused web application for the client, **JustStreamIt**.
The website, developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, 
fetches and displays movie data from a locally hosted API [OCMovies-API-EN-FR](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR).
No external frameworks were used in the development.

## Features
The application showcases movie data categorized into five sections:
1. **Best Movie:** Displays the movie with the highest IMDb rating.
2. **Top-Rated Movies:** Displays the seven Top-rated movies in all categories.
3. **Biography Top-Rated Movies:** Displays the seven Top-rated movies in Biography.
4. **Comedy Top-Rated Movies:** Displays the seven Top-rated movies in Comedy.
5. **History Top-Rated Movies:** Displays the seven Top-rated movies in the History.

**Note:**
   - **Cover image:** Each movie is represented by its cover image.
   - **Modal:** Clicking on a movieâ€™s image opens a modal displaying its details.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS.
- **Database:** SQLite.

## Project Tasks
1. **Frontend Development:** Create the application layout based on the provided mock-up.
2. **Backend Integration:** Develop JavaScript files to fetch the data from the API and render it on the weppage.
