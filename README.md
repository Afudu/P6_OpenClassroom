# Abstract

This project consists of creating a website for JustStreamIt, an organization known for publishing film rating,
a website written in pure HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript without any other framework, 
that allows to visualise featured movie's data.

In meeting the client's requirements, the website design corresponds to the mock-up provided in the project brief, 
and displays five parts: the "Best Movie" (with the highest IMDb rating), the seven "Top-Rated Movies", 
and the seven best movies of three optional categories: Biography, Comedy and History.

# Data
The data is fetched from a local version of a home-made API named OCMovies-API, and available 
on the following code repository: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR

# Installation
The following commands rely on the knowledge of how to use the terminal (Unix, macOS) or the command line (Windows).

* Download and install OC Movies API from the following repository: 
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR

* Start the API server.

The README file in the repository provides the steps to install the project dependencies and to launch the API server.

# Running the application

With the server running from the step above:

 **1 - Get this repository**
   * $ git clone https://github.com/Afudu/P6_OpenClassroom.git

 **2 - Move to the folder**
   * Unix/macOS/Windows: cd P6_OpenClassroom

 **3 - Launch the file**
   * Open the file index.html in your favorite web browser.

Note: The API server must be running to view the fetched data.

# Browser compatibility
The website has been tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and renders as expected.
